Objective: 
The purpose of this lab was to practice fundamental programming concepts, including user input validation, decision-making, and loop structures. The assignment aimed to strengthen my skills in designing and implementing functions, organizing code for clarity, and handling user input effectively. By the end, I was supposed to create a program that displays ASCII art and string decorations, allowing the user to choose among different designs and interact with the output repeatedly until they decide to stop.
Procedure: 
I started by identifying the requirements, specifically the need for functions to handle different major tasks like displaying a circle, drawing lines, and generating random designs. Then, I moved to the design phase, where I created a flowchart and an algorithm to visualize the logic of the program. For each function, I outlined its purpose, parameters, and return values, then built the main function to control user choices. Implementing iterative testing, I developed one function at a time, starting with basic output and expanding to handle more specific requirements. I used test cases, including extreme cases, to ensure the program responded correctly to valid and invalid inputs. This allowed me to refine the error-checking mechanisms to handle unexpected input.
Key Concepts Explored: 
The lab emphasized several important concepts: user input validation, decision structures, loops, and function-based programming. Error checking and usability were particularly important to ensure the program handled a variety of user inputs without crashing. Additionally, I explored string manipulation techniques, such as string multiplication and formatting, to create ASCII art and dynamically generated designs.
Results: 
My results aligned well with what I expected. The program displayed the desired ASCII art options and handled user choices smoothly.
Reflection:
One challenge I encountered was to ensure that each function worked both independently and as part of the entire program. Following the three steps of programming helped me manage these challenges: I started by clearly identifying the problem, breaking down each requirement. During the design phase, I created a flowchart and detailed each function’s algorithm. This planning reduced errors during the coding phase and helped me maintain focus on each task without overcomplicating the code.
Another challenge was creating unique designs for the random output option without looking up code examples, as required by the assignment. I did look up one for inspiration, but for the other two, I brainstormed and experimented with various patterns to develop creative designs that fit the lab guidelines.
Key Takeaways: 
The most important takeaways for me were the practice with for loops, readable code, and the practice with function design, definition, and implementation. 
Working independently was a good exercise in problem-solving, as I had to come up with solutions and designs without relying on pre-existing code.
